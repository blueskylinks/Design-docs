1. Undersdanding of BLE https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth-le.html
2. https://os.mbed.com/compiler/#nav:/mbed-os-example-ble-LED/source/main.cpp;       
    Please go through the code and try to understand about the code, you can compile the code and generate the .hex file, send this .hex file
    to the module we have with us using usb
    we can start scanning that device using the nrf connect android app
    https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp&hl=en
    Next - we need to build our own app to scan the BLE devices

//simulate the below mentioend cpp code and demonstrate the output

int l0,l1,l2,l3,l4,l5,l6;

int current_f1_status=0;
int f1_max_limit=6;
int f1_min_limit=0;
initilize_f1()
{
//set the variable lx to the 1 based on current status, for eg, if the current_f1_status=2, set the l2=1 and all other to 0
}

increment_f1()
{
//whenever this function is called, we should increment the current_f1_status+1 only until f1_max_limit and again set the respective 
//lx status = 1 and all other to 0
}

decerement_f()
{
//whenever this function is called, we should decerement the current_f1_status-1 only until f1_min_limit and again set the respective 
//lx status = 1 and all other to 0
}
